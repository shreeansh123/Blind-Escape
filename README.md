# Shadows


Setup and Instructions-->

Save the project then launch it on unity. 
Instructions are provided on the opening scene of the game.
Click "START GAME" Button to begin.





Themes Selected-->

1.Navigation
Pretty self explanatory, the player's goal is to navigate their way out of the maze successfully with their limited vision.
2.Now You See Me, Now You Don't
This theme is incorporated using the special night vision (sonar) goggles provided to the player which can be activated by holding down spacebar.
This instantly changes the vision of the player from a nearly totally blind, dark and blurred view to a crystal clear green tinted view.
The catch is that upon using the goggles, your live location is broadcasted towards enemies who begin pathfinding to you and will attempt to reach your last broadcasted location if they can get to it within 4 seconds of the goggles being deactivated (This was made to ensure that all of the enemies don't totally clump up in one spot. Closer enemies get closer to you than farther enemies this way). 


Inspiration for the game-->

I had recently played "Sons of The Forest" which was a very immersive horror-survival game in which the player finds himself on an island with various dangers. I particularly enjoyed the part of how dark the night gets where one can barely see unless he uses a torch/flashlight which happens to attract mobs (like cannibals) towards the player.
The game was extremely difficult which simply added to the immersion which i attempted to carry over to "Blind Escape".

Remarks--> 

The game does not include any audio feedback unfortunately due to time constraint which does break immersion. 
Additionally I decided to keep the enemies as cylinders instead of using a generic "monster" textured mesh on them. In my opinion, it adds to the horror of seeing such a stale, boring object suddenly begin chasing you . Additionally it can be thought of a small pointer to the show "Dr. Who" in which stone statues attempt to kill the protagonist.
